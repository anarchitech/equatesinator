The files in this directory were copied from the Kinetis SDK V1.3.0, dating
from 2015. The file I downloaded is

  Kinetis SDK 1.3.0 Mainline - Linux.tar.gz

If you manage to find and download that file from the NXP site (it's 600+ MB),
untar it and look for KSDK_1.3.0/platform/devices/<chip>/<chip>.svd

The big question is, Are there newer versions somewhere?

The answer is, YES!

Thanks once again (the first time was for the introduction of CMSIS-DAP) to
Keil. (See the Makefile, parse-pack-index.lua, and gen-downloads.lua to see
how I'm using the Keil CMSIS-Pack files.)

And because of this, I've deleted from this directory any SVD file that has a
newer version from one of the NXP CMSIS-Pack files.
